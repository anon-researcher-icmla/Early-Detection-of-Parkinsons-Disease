# 🧠 Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Characterized by tremors, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and speech impairments, PD significantly impacts the quality of life of patients. One of the major challenges in managing Parkinson’s Disease is its late diagnosis — often based on subjective clinical observation and motor symptoms that appear in the advanced stages of the disease.

This research project focuses on developing machine learning models that can aid in the **early and accurate detection** of Parkinson’s Disease using quantifiable biomedical voice measurements and sensor-based motor data. By leveraging data-driven techniques and neural networks, this project aims to:

- Analyze and preprocess speech and motor-related datasets
- Combine and synthesize multiple datasets for better prediction performance
- Identify significant biomarkers and features related to early PD detection
- Build and compare multiple machine learning and deep learning models
- Achieve high prediction accuracy and model interpretability

The ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to the development of **AI-assisted diagnostic tools** that can support healthcare professionals and improve early intervention strategies.
